# Module 9 Challenge

In this module challenge, we have to find some answers from the employee database. We are using the DBeaver free open source database management tool that allows users to interact with various databases, including PostgresSQL.

Inside our postgres Databases, we have created a new database called **'sql-challenge'**, to create and store all the tables and scripts we are using for completing this challenge.
To view the tables we have created, go through **sql-challenge --> Schemas -> public -> Tables** 
we are provided with 6 csv files. i have stored it inside the 'data' folder in the repository. Based on these csv files, we have created our tables.

## Data Modeling

To create our Entity Relationship Diagram, we used a free tool like QuickDBD to easily do the task.
