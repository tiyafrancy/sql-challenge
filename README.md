# Module 9 Challenge

In this module challenge, we have to find some answers from the employee database. We are using the DBeaver free open source database management tool that allows users to interact with various databases, including PostgresSQL.

Inside our postgres Databases, we have created a new database called **'sql-challenge'**, to create and store all the tables and scripts we are using for completing this challenge.
To view the tables we have created, go through **sql-challenge -> Schemas -> public -> Tables** 
we are provided with 6 csv files. i have stored it inside the 'data' folder in the repository. Based on these csv files, we have created our tables.

## Data Modeling

To create our Entity Relationship Diagram, we used a free tool like QuickDBD to easily do the task.

We can access the files, QuickDBD-pmd.sql and QuickDBD-ERD.png inside the EmployeeSQL folder.

## Data Engineering

We used the csv files to create the tables, and based on their needs, we have set primary key, composite key and foreign keys on each tables.
EmployeeSQL_tables.sql contains the detailed code we used to create tables. We can access this script inside the EmployeeSQL folder.
